A file integrity monitor is a software tool that checks and verifies the integrity of files in a system by comparing their current state with a previously stored state. This is done by calculating and storing a cryptographic hash of each file, which represents a unique fingerprint of its contents. The file integrity monitor periodically checks the hashes of each file and compares them with their previously stored hashes. If a file's hash has changed, it indicates that the file has been modified or corrupted, and the file integrity monitor can alert the system administrator or take other actions to mitigate the problem.

The file integrity monitor typically works by scanning a specified directory or set of directories, and calculating the hash of each file using a secure hash function such as SHA-256. The calculated hash values are then compared with previously stored hash values, which are usually kept in a database or file. If a file's hash value has changed, it indicates that the file has been modified, and the file integrity monitor can trigger an alert or perform other actions such as restoring the original file from backup.

File integrity monitoring is a critical security measure that helps to ensure the integrity and authenticity of files in a system. It can be used to detect and prevent unauthorized changes to system files, configuration files, and other important data. File integrity monitoring is often used in combination with other security measures such as intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and antivirus software to provide a comprehensive security solution.
